# heading-enumerator

This is a small JS project that automatically enumerates <h> heading elements in an HTML document that provides significant customization in how enumerations are presented. It also can create a table of contents.

To use this tool, copy [scripttiny.js](https://github.com/Astronomy487/heading-enumerator/blob/main/scripttiny.js) (or [script.js](https://github.com/Astronomy487/heading-enumerator/blob/main/script.js)) and insert it into your HTML document inside a `<script>` element.

Then call the function `heading_enumerator`, or wrap it inside `heading_enumerator_toc` to also generate a table of contents. If you don't want to read the rest of this documentation, just do something like 

```javascript
document.getElementById("toc").innerHTML = heading_enumerator_toc(heading_enumerator("heading", 2, "", "1.1.1", " "));
```

## Customization

A call to the `heading_enumerator` function might look like

```js
heading_enumerator("heading", 2, "Section ", "R.r", ": ");
```

Its five arguments are

- `target_class`: The HTML class that will have enumerations inserted. The class name provided here should only ever be applied to `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc. Non-`<h>` elements won't work.
- `starting_level`: The first `<h>` level that the enumerator will label. Anything above this level will not have its content altered.
- `prepunctuation`: Text that will come before the enumeration in all altered headings. Text here might be "Section " or "ยง".
- `form`: A string that shows how the enumeration should be formatted through various levels. Each instance of the characters "0", "1", "A", "a", "R", "r" represents a heading level that will be enumerated. Levels marked "0"/"1" use numeric enumeration beginning at 0/1 respectively; levels marked "A"/"a" use uppercase/lowercase alphabetical enumeration; levels marked "R"/"r" use uppercase/lowercase Roman numeral enumeration. Any characters other than those six are interpreted as punctuation that go between the levels. Punctuation will only appear if the level to its right is present (i.e. a `form` of "A.a" will only place periods when the second level is present). The exception is punctuation at the end of `form` (i.e. "A(1)" will show both parentheses whenever the second level is present).
- `postpunctuation`: Text that will come between the enumeration and the normal heading content.

Enumeration will begin at `starting_level` and continue for as many layers as `form` specifies. You can have it produce enumerations as deep as you want, as long as the `<h>` tags still have numbers in them.

## TOC Functionality

The `heading_enumerator` function returns an array of objects that represents all the headings it scanned and changed. Each object has the following attributes:

- `text`: The text inside the heading before any changes were made.
- `depth`: The depth of the heading, where 0 is the top level heading.
- `levels`: The heading's enumeration as a series of numbers starting at 0 joined by "-". Heading IV(a) would have a `levels` of "3-0".
- `htmlelement`: A reference to the HTML element for this heading.

You can use this array to generate your own table of contents, if you want.

If you don't want to write that yourself, the project includes the function `heading_enumerator_toc` which takes the output of `heading_enumerator` as a parameter and returns a formatted HTML table of contents, where each heading is a `<p>` element (indented appropriately) with an `<a>` element that links to the heading in the document. Inside `heading_enumerator_toc`, each heading element has an id added of the form "sec-n-n..." to make those links possible. Avoid using your own ids of this form.

You should then take the output of `heading_enumerator_toc` and put it into your own table of contents element.

A full call would look something like

```javascript
document.getElementById("toc").innerHTML = heading_enumerator_toc(heading_enumerator("heading", 2, "Section ", "R.r", ": "));
```
